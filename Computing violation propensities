We use the setup and notations from Maier et Fischer (2022).

For any two investment decisions $I,I'\in\{K,S,Q\}$, the propensity to make a second-order violation in $V_{I' I}$ in a given domain $D\in\{G,L\}$ is :
\begin{equation}\label{main}
\begin{split}
i_{I'I}^G :&= p(I|DV_{I'I}) \\
&= \frac{p(IDV_{I'I})}{p(DV_{I'I})} \\
&= \frac{p(AIDV_{I'I}) + p(BIDV_{I'I})}{p(ADV_{I'I}) + p(BDV_{I'I})}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

For instance, for an asset in gains in $V_{SQ}$ (signaling good quality), we get the following liquidating propensity.
$$\lambda_{SQ}^G = \frac{p(AQGV_{SQ})+p(BQGV_{SQ})}{p(AGV_{SQ})+p(BGV_{SQ})}$$

In order to compute these probabilities, we explicit the relevant events in terms of $(\Delta,k,l)$ coordinates, where $k$ is the number of price increases of asset A between $\tau$ and $\tau'$, and $l$ is the same for asset B.
The probability to be in a given state $(\Delta,k,l)$ is $$p(\Delta,k,l)=\sum_{j=max(0,\Delta)}^{min(\tau,\tau+\Delta)}\binom{\tau}{j}\binom{j-\Delta}{\tau}\binom{n}{k}\binom{n}{l}p_a^{j+k}(1-p_a)^{\tau+n-j-k}p_b^{j-\Delta+l}(1-p_b)^{tau+n-j+\Delta-l}$$

By fixing the investment decision at time $\tau$ (whether an event is in\\
$A=[\Delta\geq\theta]$ or $B=[-\Delta\geq\theta]$), all the relevant events are easily specified in $(\Delta,k,l)$ coordinates as follows :\\

For the gain/loss domains :
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
AG&=A\cap[k\geq g]\\
AL&=A\setminus AG\\
BG&=B\cap[l\geq g]\\
BL&=B\setminus BG
\end{split}
\end{equation*}

For the benchmark events, using $\Delta' := \Delta+k-l$ :
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
AV_{S.}&=A\cap[\Delta'\geq0]\\
BV_{S.}&=B\cap[-\Delta'\geq0]\\
V_{.Q}&=[\Delta'\geq\theta]
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
where $V_{S.}$ is the event in which switching (as opposed to keeping) is a first-order violation, and $V_{.Q}$ is the event in which liquidating (as opposed to investing) is a second-order violation, such that each benchmark event is the intersection of $V_{S.}$ or its complementary with $V_{.Q}$ or its complementary.\\

For the investment decision at time $\tau'$, the specification is given by the model considered.\\

All in all, using a model with a given parametrization yields a value for $\theta$ as well as a rule for slicing the parameter space into the events $K$, $S$ and $Q$. Computing a second-order violation propensity such as $\lambda_{SQ}^G$ then boils down to writing intersections of events in terms of $(\Delta,k,l)$ indices and summing the $p(\Delta,k,l)$ according to formula (\ref{main}) :
$$\lambda_{SQ}^G = \frac{\sum_{(\Delta,k,l)\in AQ\cap AG\cap AV_{S.}\cap V_{.Q}}p(\Delta,k,l)+\sum_{(\Delta,k,l)\in BQ\cap BG\cap BV_{S.}\cap V_{.Q}}p(\Delta,k,l)}{\sum_{(\Delta,k,l)\in  AG\cap AV_{S.}\cap V_{.Q}}p(\Delta,k,l)+\sum_{(\Delta,k,l)\in BG\cap BV_{S.}\cap V_{.Q}}p(\Delta,k,l)}$$
